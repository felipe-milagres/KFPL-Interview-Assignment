# KFPL Interview Assignment

### Drupal 10 Site Setup

Here are a few notes about this project:

- The KFPL Interview Assignment was made by Felipe Milagres. 
- The posts content was created by ChatGPT and the photos were taken from Pexels.com.
- This project uses the default Drupal theme, and most of the "defaultness" was kept intact.
- On the top right you will be able to access the Blog part of the website. You can access all the tags of the posts on a separate page called Categories, and on the sidebar when you access the Blog/Post page.
- A copy of this text can be found on the README.md file on the github repository of this project. 
- The database dump file and screenshots of the website can be found on the folder "files".
- I commented out the content of the file .gitignore file, since I want to make sure you have the complete project.
